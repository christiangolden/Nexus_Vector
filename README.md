- Dodge or destroy enemy drones
- Dock with procedurally generated space stations
- Interact with creatures inside the space stations
- Use magnetic waves to attract stardust
- Fast-paced arcade action with colorful effects

## Controls

- **Move**: Arrow keys or tilt mobile device

## Architecture

The game has been restructured to use a modular architecture:

### Core Modules
- `game.js` - Main game loop, initialization, and state management
- `input.js` - Keyboard, touch, and device orientation input handling
- `movement.js` - Coordinates all movement in the game
- `docking.js` - Manages docking with space stations

### Entity Modules
- `ship.js` - Player and enemy ship management
- `bullet.js` - Projectile management
- `dust.js` - Stardust particles and magwave attraction
- `room.js` - Procedurally generated space stations and creatures
- `star.js` - Background star field

### Utility Modules
- `collision.js` - Collision detection
- `colors.js` - Color utilities
- `performance.js` - Performance monitoring

### Other Files
- `main.js` - Entry point for the application
- `Nexus_Vector.css` - Game styling

## Performance Optimizations

The game includes several performance optimizations:
- Object pooling for bullets and dust particles
- Color caching to reduce random color generation
- Batch rendering where possible
- Star size caching to reduce string allocations
- FPS counter for performance monitoring
- Limited maximum number of stars and dust particles

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future development:
- Sound effects and music
- Additional enemy types
- Power-ups and upgrades
- Saved high scores
- Multiple levels/difficulty settings
